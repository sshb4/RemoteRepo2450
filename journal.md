- We brainstormed ideas for the YouFace social media project. Our group mainly focused on ideas for the concept. We want it to be funny and unique. I think our main ideas are a magician platform where only magicians are allowed and its super secure so the secrets don't get revealed. Also a clown dating site called Only Clowns.
    - It's interesting having a project that is more creative like this. In most classes before this point, the focus is on the creativity of the way you program, not in the concepts themselves. This one it's like we are not only coming up with how to do the thing, but also what the thing is in the first place lol

Software architecture:
- Software architecture is similar to real architecture, there are pitfalls to both.
- You need to take into account what is already built.
- It takes into account design, business, technology capabilities, and customer needs. Peoples, process, technology.

Add value: make correct technical decisions, enable communication between product and engineering, and drive sound development practices. 

Being familiar with a tool and being good at it is a good enough reason for using it. Technology choices are usually not the issue in failed projects, its usually people problems.

Making decisions between various trade-offs: speed vs storage, etc.

Ethics: the way you present information (especially to investors) can be manipulated, there is an ethical responsibility to present not only technically accurate but also really accurate information

Design: color, size, shapes, density, etc all convey meaning, add visual interest, and can make information more digestible

The people you present to, the goals you have, and design principles all should impact your presentation.

Simpler and less dense is not always better. Not always do engineers need a super duper complicated chart, and not always do investors want a super simple chart. 

Pictures can convey meaning a lot clearer.
